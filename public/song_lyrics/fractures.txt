Burning everything I know
Desperate for a change
Crashing down the ancient roads
Past our yesterday
Maybe there is hunger in my blood
Screaming out loud for what I want
See me running full speed at it, shattering, collide
Call me post-traumatic, now it's do or die
Coming after tiny fractures
Coming after tiny fractures
See me running full speed at it
Coming after tiny fractures
Call me post-traumatic
What comes after, tiny fractures

What comes after, tiny fractures
What comes after, tiny fractures
Feeding frenzy is in my brain
I'm hopeful every day, yeah
I gotta get it while we are still young enough to break
We're finally not afraid
Maybe there is hunger in my blood
Screaming out loud for what I want
See me running full speed at it, shattering, collide
Call it post-traumatic, now it's do or die
