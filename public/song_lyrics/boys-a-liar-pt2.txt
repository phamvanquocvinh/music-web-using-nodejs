Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath 'til you get down on one knee
Because you only want to hold me when I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me? Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair, well, it's only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?
The-the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy
The boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
He say that I'm good enough, grabbin' my duh-duh-duh
Thinkin' 'bout shit that I shouldn't have (huh)
So I tell him there's one of me, he makin' fun of me (ha-ha)
His girl is a bum to me (grrah)
Like that boy is a cap, sayin' he home but I know where he at, like
Bet he blowin' her back
Thinkin' 'bout me 'cause he know that ass fat (damn)
And it been what it been (uh, huh)
Callin' his phone like, "Yo, send me your PIN"
Duckin' my shit, 'cause he know what I'm on (grrah)
But when he hit me I'm not gon' respond (grrah)
But I don't sleep enough without you
And I can't eat enough without you (huh)
If you don't speak, does that mean we're through? (Huh)
Don't like sneaky shit that you do (grrah)
The-the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy
The boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-oughs
