Hey baby, when we are together doing things that we love
â™ª
Every time you're near, I feel like I'm in heaven, feeling high
I don't want to let go, girl (girl)
I just need you to know, girl (girl)
I don't wanna run away
Baby, you're the one I need tonight
No promises
Baby, now I need to hold you tight
I just wanna die in your arms here tonight
