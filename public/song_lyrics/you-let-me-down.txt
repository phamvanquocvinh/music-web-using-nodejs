You, evergreen, the fire in my past
Can't run free if I keep looking back
It's a lost cause
It's a bad bet
It's a storm but, gotta face it
Oh, I
I love you but you let me down
Yeah, yeah, oh, I
I, I love you but you let me down
â™ª
The last time for an eternity
You're only mine when I am on my feet
You're elusive, and it kills me
Inconclusive, never ending
Oh, I
I, I love you but you let me down
Yeah, yeah, oh, I
I, I love you but you let me down
And I'll go as fast as I can
No time for a moment to myself
And I'll go as fast as I can
I swear on my life, it's for the best
And I might call you, on your birthday
Cover words I wanted to say, with some small talk
And I'll tear up, but I'll go on
And I'll hang up before I can say
I love you, but you let me down, no, no
Oh, I, I
I, I love you but you let me down
And I'll go as fast as I can
No time for a moment to myself
And I'll go as fast as I can
I swear on my life it's for the best
Though our moment kept us waiting
I will keep it, keep it sacred
Like it's golden
Wish you nothing
But an exhale
And I'm hoping
You hear when I say
I never meant to let you down, oh
Oh, I
I love you but you let me down
