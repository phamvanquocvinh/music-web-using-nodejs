I hope you understand that I have to send you away
You may not understand but I know that you will one day
You're broken, I know this
And if you knew it, you would love me a whole different way
But that's how love goes, goes
That's how love goes, goes
Goes, goes
That's how love goes
I tried to change you, tried to make you into someone else
(Someone else)
I guess the only one I'm fooling is my stupid self
You're broken, we know that
And if you knew it, you won't fight me when I say farewell
That's how love goes, goes
That's how love goes, goes
Goes, goes
That's how love goes, goes
Goes, goes
That's how love goes, goes
Goes, goes
That's how love
Say that one day, I'll be back
Don't hold your breath
Just know I'll hold a place for you, always
'Cause that's how love goes, goes
That's how love goes, goes (goes)
Goes, goes
That's how love goes, goes
Goes, goes
That's how love goes, goes
Goes, goes (goes)
That's how love (goes)
â™ª
Yeah, yeah
Oh, ooh
That's how love goes, yeah (ooh)
Whoa
