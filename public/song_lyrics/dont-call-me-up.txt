When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know it's sad that I changed, have a cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
I gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
And you're alone, going out of your mind
But I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up
'Cause I'm here looking fine, babe
And I got eyes looking my way
And everybody's on my vibe, babe
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
My friends said you were a bad man
I should have listened to them back then
And now you're tryna hit me up again
Now, now, now, now
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know it's sad that I changed, have a cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
I gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
And you're alone, going out of your mind
But I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up
Don't call me up
So don't call me up
Don't call me up
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know it's sad that I changed, have a cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Hmm, I'm over you
Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life
Don't wanna talk about us
I gotta leave it behind
One drink and you're outta my mind
Now, now take it up
Baby, I'm on a high
And you're alone, going out of your mind
But I'm here up in the club
And I don't wanna talk
So don't call me up
Don't call me up
So don't call me up
Don't call me up
So don't call me up
