No-no, no-no, no-no-no
I let you down, I led you on
I never thought I'd be here without you
Don't let me drown inside your arms
Bad thoughts inside my mind
When the darkness comes, you're my light, baby
My light, baby, my light when it's dark, yeah
I'm too high, baby, too high, baby
'Cause I know right now, that I lost it (hey)
It's way too late to save our souls, baby
Oh, oh, yeah
It's way too late, we're on our own

Oh, oh, yeah
It's way too late to save my, my-
And, ooh, I tell myself I should get over you
I said, ooh, I know I'd rather be all over you

It's way too late to save our souls, baby (souls, baby)
Oh, oh, yeah (ooh)
It's way too late (ooh), we're on our own (ooh-yeah)
Baby, on my own (ooh-yeah, ooh-yeah)
I've made mistakes (mistakes)
I did you wrong, baby (oh, baby)
Oh, oh, yeah
It's way too late to save my, my-
