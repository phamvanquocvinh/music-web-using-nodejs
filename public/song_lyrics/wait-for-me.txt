Midnight hour almost over
Time is running out for the magic pair
I know you gave the best that you have
But one more chance couldn't be all that hard to bear
Wait for me, please, wait for me
All right, I guess that's more than I should ask, but won't you?
Wait for me (wait for me), please, wait for me (wait for me)
Although I know the light is fading fast
You could go either way, is it easier to stay
I wonder what you'll do when your chance rolls around
But you gotta know how much I want to keep you
When I'm away, I'm afraid it will all fall down
So wait for me, please, wait for me
All right, I guess that's more than I should ask, but won't you?
Wait for me (wait for me), please, wait for me (wait for me)
Although I know the light is fading fast, yeah

Love is what it does and ours is doing nothing
But all the time we spent, it must be good for something
Please, forgive all the disturbance I'm creating
But you got a lot to learn if you think that I'm not waiting for you
So wait for me, please, wait for me
All right, I guess that's more than I should ask, so, won't you?
Wait for me (wait for me), please, wait for me (wait for me)
Although I know the light is fading fast, yes, it is
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, waiting
You got a lot to learn if you think that I'm not waiting for you
So wait for me, please, wait for me
All right, I guess that's more than I should ask
So, won't you wait for me (wait for me)? Please, wait for me
Although I know the light is fading fast, yes, it is
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
You got a lot to learn if you think that I'm not waiting for you
Wait for me, please, wait for me
All right, I guess that's more than I should ask
So, won't you wait? So, won't you wait (wait for me)?
Although I know the light is fading fast
