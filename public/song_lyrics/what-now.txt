When life was once so easy
I always came back for more
Didn't think that you would end it all
I thought that you'd be there for me
Together living happily
But you changed your ways so suddenly
I thought that we were happy
But I was just too heavy on you
What now, what the hell am I supposed to do
You left me naked in the cold, nowhere to run,
Nowhere to go (oh, baby)
How though, I was always your number one
You took the best of me and history will show
That you moved on from something good
Can you say that you are happy now
Did you find what you were looking for
Do you believe that it was worth it
I thought that we were happy
(Don't you agree, you always took the best of me)
But I was just too heavy on you
What now, What the hell am I supposed to do
You left me naked in the cold, nowhere to run
Nowhere to go (oh baby)
How though, I was always your number one
You took the best of me and history will show
That you moved on from something
Good, What happened to our love
I thought I meant more to you
And now we're through
What now, What the hell am I supposed to do
You left me naked in the cold, nowhere to run,
Nowhere to go (oh, baby)
How though, I was always your number one
You took the best of me and history will show
That you moved on from something good
