I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there, 'cause
We just love to dream
In my fantasy when you woke up, oh
It's not you, baby, it's just me
I don't believe what I just lost
I don't want to close my eyes
Nobody wants to fall (fall) after they did it all (all)
I wonder if I left my body there, would I
Die right in my sleep (sleep) but in reality ('ty)
It could feel like anything is possible
When I hear you speak, it really drives it deep
Woke up in a sweat in the middle of the night
It's gettin' under my skin, baby
I wouldn't wonder why
I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms
I got everything, everything but real love
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out
Or you could leave me there, 'cause
We just love to dream
In my fantasy when you woke up, oh
It's not you, baby (na-na-na-na-na), it's just me (na-na-na-na-na)
I don't believe (na-na-na-na-na), what I just lost (na-na-na-na-na)
(I said, I said, I said, na-na-na-na-na)
And I said, "Ooh, stop it", ayy
I look a little like 'Nashe, ayy
You look a little exhausted, ayy (yah)
We should say "nah" to the party, ayy (huh)
Take me home in the Bugatti, ayy (yah)
Hope you like a little tear, put it on his tittie
Like when ya rub my tum, ayy
Jump in bed without my bonnet, ah (my bonnet)
Take a minute for the finer things (yah)
I don't even wanna sleep
You doin' some weed, blow it in my China bang
I be havin' hella dreams
Pickin' up his sheets feelin' like a tidal wave
Hit me if you want it right away
If he hit me with the mornin' sex
Show up, hit him with apologies
Kicks on him with a pile of J's
Bricks on him with a dick on him (yo)
Put a fit on him with the Prada shades (Prada shades)
Tits on him and I ride away (ride away)
(How much do you want it?) Twice a day
(Four times) on the holidays (yuh)
King come through, your dreams come true
And trust me, you won't ever fall asleep
I know what you mean, you don't fuck with randoms (and I hope you)
I got everything, everything but real love (and I hope you)
I got in my head, I bet you could get me back out (and I hope you)
Or you could leave me there, 'cause (or leave me there)
We just love to dream (and I hope you)
In my fantasy (and I hope you) when you woke up, oh (and I hope you)
(Oh, baby, baby), it's not you, baby (na-na-na-na-na), it's just me (na-na-na-na-na)
I don't believe (na-na-na-na-na), what I just lost (na-na-na-na-na), oh
