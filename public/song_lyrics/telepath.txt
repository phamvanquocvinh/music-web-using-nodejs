Don't even finish that sentence babe
Already know how this ends
You say we're breaking up
What a shame
Don't even wanna stay friends

'Cause I got a feelin'
You're comin' back
Just like you have in the past
Yeah, I got a feeling
You'll be sendin' me trash
You shoulda left in the drafts
Yeah, I got a feelin'
You'll see me movin' on
And hate that I'm gone
I can see it
You're comin' back

Drunk and asking me for a kiss

That you hate my guts
