Sometimes I just drive
'Til the night turns off my mind
I'm passing cars and crowded bars
Never know until I go too far
Confusing faith and fear
Paint a smile from ear to ear
'Cause if I blink, I start to think
I feel nothing, I feel everything
I try my best to turn down the noise
And I tell myself that boys will be boys
It's getting harder to breathe so, baby, put me to sleep
'Til it gets better
So wake me up when it's over
It's over
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And wake me up when it's over (over)
It's over (over)
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And I'II believe it
Keep me in the dark
Then fast-forward to the part
With endless nights and neon lights
I'II be beautiful and starry-eyed
I try my best to turn down the noise
And I tell myself that boys will be boys
It's getting harder to breathe so, baby, put me to sleep
'Til it gets better
So wake me up when it's over
It's over
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And wake me up when it's over (over)
It's over (over)
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And I'II believe it

Sometimes I just drive
When I can't turn off my mind
I don't know where, I'll meet you there
Someday
So wake me up when it's over
It's over
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And wake me up when it's over (over)
It's over (over)
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And I'II believe it
