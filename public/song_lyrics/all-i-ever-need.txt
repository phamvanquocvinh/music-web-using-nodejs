Don't the water grow the trees?
Don't the moon pull the tide?
Don't the stars light the sky
Like you need to light my life?
If you need me anytime
You know I'm always right by your side
And see, I've never felt this love
You're the only thing that's on my mind
You don't understand how much you really mean to me
I need you in my life, you're my necessity, yeah
But believe me, you're everything that just makes my world complete
My love is clear, the only thing that I'll ever see
You're all I ever need
Baby, you're amazing
You're my angel, come and save me
Oh
You're all I ever need
Baby, you're amazing
You're my angel, come and save me
Oh
Don't the water grow the trees?
Don't the moon pull the tide?
Don't the stars light the sky
Like you need to light my life?
We can do anything you like
I know we both can get it right tonight
You got your walls built up high
I can tell by looking in your eyes
You don't understand how much you really mean to me
I need you in my life, you're my necessity, yeah
But believe me, you're everything that just makes my world complete
My love is clear, the only thing that I'll ever see
You're all I ever need

Baby, you're amazing
You're my angel, come and save me
Oh
You're all I ever need
Baby, you're amazing
You're my angel, come and save me
Oh
When it comes to you, baby, I'm addicted
You're like a drug, no rehab can fix it
I think you're perfect, baby, even with your flaws
You ask what I like about you, ooh, I love it all
When it comes to you, baby, I'm addicted
You're like a drug, no rehab can fix it
