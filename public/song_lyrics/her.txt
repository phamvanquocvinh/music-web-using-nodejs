I don't care if these bitches don't like me
'Cause, like, I'm pretty as fuck, hahahaha
Just the other day, I heard a hoe say...
Matter of fact, what could a hoe say?
With a face like this and a bitch this paid
Shit, what could a hoe say?
The bag so expensive, my pussy came with it
Body so nice, they be saying, "Who did it?"
But everything natural, actual, factual
Prissy in the streets, but I fuck like an animal
All you hoes know who the fuck I am
From your boyfriend down to my Instagram
To all them busted-ass hoes that you kiki with
I bet your jaw drop if you ever see me, bitch
I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic', it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends "this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her" (ah)
Bitch, you do you and whatever that is, I'ma do it better
Hoes must've just seen me and they playing catch-up
Bitches looking like lil' Megans playing dress-up
Would I ever spin the block on a nigga? Never
I'on even wear an outfit twice, dead 'em
Any bitch got a problem? Probably never met 'em
Tell a hater, "kiss both cheeks, ciao bella"
But I'm used to the chatter 'cause
I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic', it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends "this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her" (ah)
All this hate giving me a pretty face
I eat hate, that's why I ain't got a waist
The more hoes hating, more money I'ma make
And the more niggas talk, more niggas want a taste
'Cause I'm the most sickening, hoes so fucking sick of me
No matter what they do or say, it ain't no getting rid of me
I come in every room and draw attention like a centerpiece
Stepping for a long time, moving like a centipede
I ain't scared of shit, man or bitch
To everybody hating, y'all can suck this clit
'Cause the hate campaign ain't working at all
I ain't Jack or Jill, bitch, I ain't gon' fall
I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends "this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her" (ah)
