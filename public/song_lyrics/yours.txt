Tell me if you feel it
'Cause I know you do
Tell me if you need it
'Cause I'm here for you
I can't help believing
That you're talking true
I can't help believing in you
You know I
Can't stop
Won't stop
Darling I keep thinking
We could be more than
You'll ever know
I'll run with you
Into the night
Chasing the stars
Inside your eyes
Crossing the bridge
Until we find
Our way back home
When I'm with you
I'm so alive
Never afraid to stand and fight
Tell me I'm yours

I know what you're saying
When you look at me
I know what you're thinking
But I guess we'll see
I can't help believing
That you want me too
I can't help believing in you
You know I
Can't stop
Won't stop
Darling I keep thinking
We could be more than
You'll ever know
I'll run with you
Into the night
Chasing the stars
Inside your eyes
Crossing the bridge
Until we find
Our way back home
When I'm with you
I'm so alive
Never afraid to stand and fight
Waiting until our hearts collide
