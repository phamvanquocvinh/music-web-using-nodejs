Oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh
When you said you were leaving
To work on your mental health
You didn't mention the cheating, yeah
You kept that one to yourself
I got so mad, was gonna
Cuss you out outside your house
For everyone to see
Wanted to trash your Benz, tell all your friends
How cruel you were to me, to me, to me
Instead, I wrote a song 'bout how you did me wrong
I could've cried at home and spent the night alone
Instead, I wrote a song, I feel much better now
Me and my girls are out, and we all sing along
Instead, I wrote a song
Da-da-da-da-da-di
Da-da-da-da-da-di (woo-woo)
Da-da-da-da-da-di
Instead, I wrote a song
Da-da-da-da-da-di
Da-da-da-da-da-di (woo-woo)
Da-da-da-da-da-di
Instead, I wrote a song
I kept my cool and composure
My mother would be so proud (she would be so proud)
I was ready for a sentence, baby
Instead, I wrote it all down
Oh, I was gonna
Cuss you out outside your house
For everyone to see
Wanted to trash your Benz, tell all your friends
How cruel you were to me, to me, to me
Instead, I wrote a song 'bout how you did me wrong
I could've cried at home and spent the night alone
Instead, I wrote a song, I feel much better now
Me and my girls are out, and we all sing along
Instead, I wrote a song
Da-da-da-da-da-di
Da-da-da-da-da-di (woo-woo)
Da-da-da-da-da-di
Instead, I wrote a song
Da-da-da-da-da-di
Da-da-da-da-da-di (woo-woo)
Da-da-da-da-da-di
Instead, I wrote a song
Let's celebrate, dance it away
I thought my heart would break
Instead, I wrote a song 'bout how you did me wrong
I could've cried at home and spent the night alone
Instead, I wrote a song, I feel much better now
Me and my girls are out, and we all sing along
Instead, I wrote a song
