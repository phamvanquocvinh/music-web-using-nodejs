I see you when you're down
And depressed, just a mess
I see you when you cry
When you're shy
When you want to die
I see you when you smile
It takes a while
At least you're here
I see you
Yes, I see you
I'm alone with you
You're alone with me
I see you when you hide
And when you lie, it's no surprise
I see you when run from the light
Within your eyes
I see you when you think
That I don't notice all those scars
I see you
Yes, I see you
I'm alone with you
You're alone with me
What a mess you've made of everything
I'm alone with you
You're alone with me
And I'm hoping that you will see yourself
Like I see you
♪
Yes, I see you
I see you
Yes, I see you
♪
I'm alone with you
You're alone with me
I see you when you chase
All the dreams inside your head
I see you when you laugh
And when you love until the bitter end
I see you in the dark
At the dawn of something new
I see you
Yes, I see you
I'm alone with you
You're alone with me
And I'm hoping that you will see yourself
Like I see you
Yes, I see you
I see you
Yes, I see you

Even when you cry
And even when you're shy
You mean everything to me
Even when you lie
And even when you hide
You mean everything to me

Yes, I see you

I see you
Even when you cry
And even when you're shy
Yes, I see you

I'm alone with you
You're alone with me
And I'm hoping that you will see yourself
