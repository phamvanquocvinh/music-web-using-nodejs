Keep thinkin' that I'm seein' water
You're playing tricks on me in the sun
See your shadow in the courtyard
Stays until the day is done
The desert don't end, the rain don't fall
And I can't pretend I don't want you all
'Cause I want you all
You all, you all, you all
Oh, babe, I really need you
My feelings gettin' deeper
My mind is in a free fall
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
You play with my emotions
I'm flowin' like the ocean
I pray for your devotion
'Cause there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you
Wait a minute, tell me why you're movin' like that
Na, you wey I choose, but you make it so hard
I gave you my heart, you're makin' it so dark
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
You takin' it for granted
A lot of silence, the river don't end
'Cause I want you all, yeah
You all, you all, you all
Oh, babe, I really need you (Oh, baby)
My feelings gettin' deeper
My mind is in a free fall
But there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
You play with my emotions
I'm flowin' like the ocean
I pray for your devotion
'Cause there's nothing I can do when it comes to you
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
My oa-, my oa-, my oasis
There's nothing I can do when it comes to you
I remember say me tell you
You're my all and you're my everything
And me tell you 'til it's all over
Oluwa Burna, oh
