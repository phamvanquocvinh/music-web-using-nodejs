Flirting with her is like butterflies screaming
Taking off into the night
Flirting with her is like cool night beaming
Stars glued to my thighs
Aah, aah, aah
I'll lend you this, I'll lend you that
"How is it that you two always seem to match?"
I'll lend you this, I'll lend you that
Just promise that you'll never give it back

Flirting with her is like skinning your knee
Reconciling with the concrete
Flirting with her is like losing your key
What the fuck is going on with me?
Aah, aah, aah
I'll lend you this, I'll lend you that
"How is it that you two always seem to match?"
I'll lend you this, I'll lend you that
Just promise that you'll never give it back

She left her name on my lips
I don't think I'll ever get over her hips
Or ever feel like anything else exists
When she texts me "hey"
She left her name on my lips
I don't think I'll ever get over her hips
Or ever feel like anything else exists
When she texts me
Brring... hey!
I'll lend you this, I'll lend you that
"How is it that you two always seem to match?"
I'll lend you this, I'll lend you that
How is it that we always seem to match?
