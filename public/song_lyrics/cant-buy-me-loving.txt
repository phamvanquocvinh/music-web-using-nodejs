Why is there so much faking under the sun?
Everyone I see makes me just wanna run

Can't buy me lovin'
Me lovin', me lovin'
Can't buy me lovin'
Can't buy me lovin', la-la-la
Can't buy me lovin'
Me lovin'
Every time you say, "I do"
And I just can't stop all the thoughts that cross my mind
What if I don't give you?
What you're craving for, would you leave me behind?
Life is full of treachery and pain
You're only in for the money, in love with my money
I don't care much for you
Get out of my sight and leave me behind
