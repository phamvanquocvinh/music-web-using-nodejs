Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Green eyes, fried rice, I could cook an egg on you
Late night, game time, coffee on the stove, yeah (oh)
You're sweet ice cream, but you could use a Flake or two
Blue bubblegum twisted 'round your tongue
I don't want you to get lost
I don't want you to go broke
I want you
It's 'cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way
Just a little taste
You know I love you, babe
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba (you know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba

Excuse me, a green tea? Music for a sushi restaurant
From ice on rice, scuba-duba-dubub-boo (oh)
Music for a sushi restaurant, music for a sushi restaurant
Music for whatever you want, scuba-duba-dubub-boo (oh)
I'm not going to get lost
I'm not going to go broke
Staying cool
(You know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba (you know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
(Ba, ba-ba, ba-ba) if the stars were edible
(Ba-ba) and our hearts were never full
(Ba, ba-ba, ba-ba) could we live with just a taste?
Just a taste (ba-ba)
(Ba, ba-ba) it's 'cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way (ba-ba)
Just a little taste (ba-ba)
You know I love you, babe
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba (you know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
