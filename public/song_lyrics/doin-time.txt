Summertime
And the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the L.B.C
Me, me, and Louie
We gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm
It gets harder
Me and my girl
We got this relationship
I love her so bad
But she treats me like shit
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home
There's none left for me

Oh, take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun
Will some day rise
So, what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said, I'm gonna play with myself
Show them how we come off the shelf

Evil
We've come to tell you that she's evil
Most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil
Most definitely
The tension
It's getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater
