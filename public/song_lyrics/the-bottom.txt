I told you I was down bad
You hate to see me like that
I don't know how you look past
My stupid fucking setbacks
When you opened up the door
You let me in when you should have your guard up
What a painful back and forth, oh-oh
It's hard to ignore all of my problems
Gonna regret being too honest
Calling it love, but this isn't falling
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom
'Cause you're no good
You could do better
You should walk out
It's now or never
I took the most that you could offer
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom
I told you I was down bad
You could never fix that
I'm happier when I'm sad (sad)
So leave and never come back
When you opened up the door
You lеt me in when you should have your guard up
What a painful back and forth, oh-oh
It's hard to ignorе all of my problems
Gonna regret being too honest
Calling it love, but this isn't falling
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom
'Cause you're no good
You could do better
You should walk out
It's now or never
I took the most that you could offer
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom
Watch me drag you down
No saving you now
Watch me drag you down
There's no getting out
Watch me drag you down
No saving you now
Watch me drag you down
It's hard to ignore all of my problems
Gonna regret being too honest
Calling it love, but this isn't falling
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom
'Cause you're no good
You could do better
You should walk out
It's now or never
I took the most that you could offer
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom
