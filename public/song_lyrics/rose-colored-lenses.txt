Sunrise got us up early
So we put on our shade
Somehow the bedsheets are dirty
Like sticky sweet lemonade
Never wanna leave this room
Daydream, déjà vu
If I had control over you
We could stay like this forever, lost in wonderland
With our head above the clouds, fallin' stupid like we're kids
Wearin' rose colored lenses, let's just play pretend
Wearin' rose colored lenses, pretend we'll never end
Naked in conversation
Drown me in your delight
Endless summer vacation
Make it last 'til we die
My baby got looks that kill (kill)
Make a mess of a nice hotel ('tel)
If I had control over you
We could stay like this forever, lost in wonderland
With our head above the clouds, fallin' stupid like we're kids
Wearin' rose colored lenses, let's just play pretend
Wearin' rose colored lenses, pretend we'll never end
Let's stay like this forever
Let's stay like this forever
Let's stay like this forever
Let's stay like this forever
