Trying to forget you
I'm all alone
In a ghost town
There's a beautiful madness
Inside my soul
And I can't stop (Stop)
Thinking of you
Walking on a lonely avenue
Are you?
Are you?
Are you?
My love's so wild
Please give me a sign
My love's so wild
Please give me, baby
My love's so wild

Fading in the dark (Dark)
All the lights
Go down
I'm feeling high and drunk
Close my eyes
And I can't stop (Stop)
Thinking of you
Walking on a lonely avenue
Are you?
Are you?
Are you?
