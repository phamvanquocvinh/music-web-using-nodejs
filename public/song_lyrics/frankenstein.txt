Put me together, thread a needle
So I'm like other people without all of the evil (ah, ah, ah)
I'm trying to be normal, but trauma is immortal
And none of this is your fault (ah, ah, ah)
Oh, my God, this is so unbearable
Make it stop, this is more than medical
All I want is to feel beautiful inside and out
You're the one who can save me from myself
Destruction, 999, I need your help
All I want is to feel beautiful
Put me together one more time
Love me forever, fix me right
I could be your Frankenstein, Frankenstein
Put me together, make me better
Love me forever, hold me tight
I could be your Frankenstein, Frankenstein
I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be a monster anymore (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be a monster (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be a monster anymore (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be a monster
I was doing fine
'Til I hit rock bottom
Opened up my problems
Watch that poison blossom
Oh, my God, this is so unbearable
Make it stop, this is more than medical
All I want is to feel beautiful inside and out
You're the one who can save me from myself
Destruction, 999, I need your help
All I want is to feel beautiful
Put me together one more time
Love me forever, fix me right
I could be your Frankenstein, Frankenstein
Put me together, make me better
Love me forever, hold me tight
I could be your Frankenstein, Frankenstein
I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster (I don't wanna be)
I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster (I don't wanna be)
I don't wanna be a monster anymore (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be a monster (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be a monster anymore
I don't wanna be a monster
