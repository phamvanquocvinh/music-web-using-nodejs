A dedication to all the refugees worldwide
One time
Say, say, say I remember when we used to sit in the government yard in Brooklyn
Oba-observing the crookedness as it mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past, so dry your tears, I say
And to my peeps who passed away
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, say, say, say
Oh, hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
Say, say, say I remember when we used to rock, oh in a project yard in Jersey
And little Georgie would make the firelight as stolen cars passed through the night
And then we'd hit the corner store for Roots, paper, and brew, brew
My drink's my only remedy for pain of losing family
But while I'm gone, shorty
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Fugees come to the dance tonight
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Oh, everything is gonna be alright
The gunman's in the house tonight
But everything is gonna be alright
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah (i'm high)
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
Hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
Say, say, say I remember when we used to sit in a government yard in Trenchtown
Oba-observing the hypocrites as they mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost along the way, hey
In this great future, you can't forget your past so dry your tears, I say
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, say, say, say
Hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry
And to my peeps who passed away
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
