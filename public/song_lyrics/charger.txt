God, that's so classic
I'm three precent away from being stranded
The way I left was way too cinematic
The realization hadn't even landed
God fuckin' dammit
Don't wanna be put back, back in a moment where
I'd wanna change my own mind
Already got my bags, already cleared the air
Do I even need it that bad?
And I wanna come back
'Cause I left my, left my, left my charger
(But) I don't wanna go back
It'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
Should be by the bedside and, if I'm right, on the left side, yeah
(But) That'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
And when you find it
I know you'll think that there's somethin' behind it
Roll your eyes and say, "She's probably dying"
You'll wait the night and act like you're not tryin'
But I'm not bitin'
Don't wanna be put back, back in a moment where
I'd wanna change my own mind
Already got my bags, already cleared the air
Do I even need it that bad?
And I wanna come back
'Cause I left my, left my, left my charger
(But) I don't wanna go back
It'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
Should be by the bedside and, if I'm right, on the left side, yeah
(But) That'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
And I wanna come back
'Cause I left my, left my, left my charger
I don't wanna go back
It'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
Should be by the bedside and, if I'm right, on the left side, yeah
But that'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
And if I'm gonna go back
Would you make it, make it harder?
'Cause I don't wanna go back
To the moment when I left and how it started
And I think this was a sign
But if you're fine, it don't feel right, yeah
'Cause it'll make it, make it, make it, make it harder
