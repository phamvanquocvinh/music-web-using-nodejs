Oh congratulations, you found the one, you found the one
I think I can finally face that I'm not the one, never was the one
God, I dodged a bullet
I ran fast right through it
I love myself too much to fight you
But oh congratulations, you found the one
Another one (another one)
You found the one
Another one

You found the one
Another one
Honestly, I'm happy for you
I do not wish you no harm
I met your boyfriend, he's beautiful
Please treat him like he's someone
Someone perfect, someone so divine
Someone special, someone good inside
I don't want him to hurt like me
Just please treat him like he's someone
But oh congratulations, you found the one, you found the one
I think I can finally face that I'm not the one, never was the one
God, I dodged a bullet
I ran fast right through it
I love myself too much to fight you
But oh congratulations, you found the one
Another one
Move through him like water
Love stains on the sun
Don't say I didn't warn ya
You'll never be enough
