Wise man, call me a crazy
Lovin' foolishly
Dream about you all the time
Every night I fall asleep
Chasing and dreaming
Looking for your eyes, Daisy
I am the foolish Gatsby who's found drown in love
Can't you see my heart burnin' right through my hands?
'Cause your smile lifts me above and beyond the blue sky
In the darkest moments, here I still can see your eyes
Love you to the moon and back
I can't let you know this fact
Love you to the moon and back
I'm so freakin' missin' you
Aim for the moon yet so far (so far)
I can't land among the stars
Love you to the moon and back
I'm so freakin' missin' you (I'm so freakin' missin' you)
I'll never let my love get so close (to, be, doo, wah)
To you 'cause it hurts swear to God
I wish I could (no, no, no)
'Cause I'm the foolish Gatsby who's found drown in love
Can't you see my heart burning right through my hands?
Da, de, bah, bah (whoa)
'Cause your smile lifts me above and beyond the blue sky
In the darkest moments, here still can see your eyes
Love you to the moon and back
I can't let you know this fact
Love you to the moon and back
I'm so freakin' missin' you
Aim for the Moon, yet so far
I can't land among the stars
Love you to the moon and back
I'm so freakin' missin' you
Love you to the moon and back
I can't let you know this fact
Love you to the moon and back
I'm so freakin' missin' you
Aim for the moon yet so far
I can't land among the stars
Love you to the moon and back
I'm so freakin' missin' you
