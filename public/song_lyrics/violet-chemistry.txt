When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don't wanna leave
And your phone is lost
But the car's outside waitin out on the street
Tonight we'll just be wrong
Ain't done this in so long
We ain't gotta talk baby
We'll keep the stereo on
When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don't wanna leave
Stay awhile, stay awhile with me
Stay awhile, don't deny the violet chemistry
Stay awhile, stay awhile with me
♪
Stay awhile, put your arms around me
Put them around me
When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don't wanna leave
Can I bum a cigarette?
We could paint our names in black on the marquee
Tonight we'll just be wrong
Ain't done this in so long
We ain't gotta talk baby
We'll keep the stereo on
When the floor is wet
And the lights come on but you don't wanna leave
Stay awhile, stay awhile with me
Stay awhile, don't deny the violet chemistry
Stay awhile, stay awhile with me
♪
Stay awhile, put your arms around me
Put them around me
Fingers start to dance along the figures and the shapes
Mixing all the colors like we're making a Monet
There's something between us that's too major to ignore
May not be eternal but nocturnal nothing more
