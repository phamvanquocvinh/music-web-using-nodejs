A slight chance of showers and thunderstorms after midnight
Your smile's like a dark cloud, can't wait for the fallout
Big joke, but the kids don't get it, big words, but it's not poetic
Lost touch tryna save me, no time for it lately
Big sigh, but it's so dramatic
It's not like I don't care, don't understand
I'm not gonna get there holding your hand
Temperature is rising, watch the sunset
Know I better say this before I forget
I don't wanna be like you (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be like you (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be like you (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be like you (ooh-ooh)
I'm trying to be patient, decipher what you're saying
But I feel like I'm stuck inside of your imagination
Just like this conversation, it's never gonna end
Go fuck yourself and all of your friends
I don't wanna be like you (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be like you (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be like you (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be like you (ooh-ooh)
It's not like I don't care, don't understand
I'm not gonna get there holding your hand
Said I gotta stay and trust the process
Know I better say this before I forget
I don't wanna be like you (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be like you (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be like you (ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna be like you (ooh-ooh)
