She planned ahead for a year
He said, "Let's play it by ear"
She didn't want him to run
He didn't want her to fear
Nobody said it'd be easy
They knew it was rough, but tough luck
I fell in love today
There aren't many words that you can say
That could ever get my mind to change
She's enough for me, she's in love with me
You're a doll, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
The only flaw, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
So, she put his heart in a bag
He wouldn't ask for it back
He didn't want her to cry
She didn't want to be sad
She said, you'd better not leave me
This shit it'll be fucked for days, and weeks, and months, but
I fell in love today
There aren't many words that you can say
That could ever get my mind to change
She's enough for me, she's in love with me
You're a doll, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
The only flaw, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
When I add it all up, I can't find it
The problem with love, is I'm blinded by it
It rattles my lungs, but my mind is
Tangled between your little flaws
Your flaws, your flaws, your flaws
You're a doll, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
The only flaw, you are flawless
But I just can't wait for love to destroy us
I just can't wait for love
Wait for love
I won't wait for love
Wait for love
I won't wait for love
Wait for love
