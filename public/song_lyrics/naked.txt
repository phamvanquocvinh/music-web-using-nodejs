Baby, you're so anxious, you can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get nake-?
Baby, you're so anxious, you can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked? Ah
I don't think 'bout anybody, but being beside your body, baby
(La-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la, ah-ah)
You can leave open windows, don't care who see me out my clothes, baby
(Oh-oh, oh)
Yeah, I like bananas and peaches
And some might say it's indecent
That's just crazy (that's just crazy)
Can I slide outta mine and into yours?
Heels on, waiting at your door
I don't wanna play no more, leave everything on the floor
You don't need a pole to see me strip
Only thing I want zipped is your lips
Take it to the top, boy, skinny dip
(So hot, your body on mine, your body on)
I don't even wanna get a grip
I just like it when you grab my hips
Can you feel it through your fingertips? (How do I?)
How do I keep this on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deserve to get comfortable, it's only natural
I could tell when you locked the door just what was going on
Boy, can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes? (When? Oh, whoa)
When can we take off all our clothes?

Follow me to my dressing room
Let me know if you ain't 'bout that NSFW
Now it's safe to finish what we started
First impression of you is you really like to party
Swirling all up on you 'cause you know I wanna dance
Let me cordially invite you to this party in my pants
How you got me sprung and don't say sorry in advance?
Show me all your tatt's, not just the ones that's on your hands
Who's your designer? Is that birthday suit one of a kind, uh?
Everything about you look like it's on purpose
God was working, probably took some extra time though
Ayy, all up in my curves like a puzzle piece, mmm
Jigsaw, let me see your muscleses, mmm
After we fuck, I'ma wanna cuddle
We could take it to the kitchen
I'll be on the island, come and eat, mmm
How do I keep this on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deserve to get comfortable, it's only natural
I could tell when you locked the door just what was going on
Boy, can we take off all our clothes?
Anxious, you can't take it

Touch, touch my body

Yeah, touch, touch my body
