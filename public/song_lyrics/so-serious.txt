Put your hands in the air if you sometimes ever get sad like me
Put your fingers on your chest and your body and breathe, let it be
Don't find it hard to say so
I'll say it, "I get lonely"
Put your hands in the air if you sometimes ever get sad like me
Sad like me, wait patiently
And you're gonna be free
Wait patiently
I get so serious sometimes
My emotions sittin' on a wire
And I gotta be out my mind
'Cause the second that I'm happy and I'm fine
Suddenly there's violins and movie scenes
And cryin' rivers in the streets
And, God, I don't know why I get so serious sometimes
(So serious) So serious sometimes
I remember last summer in the city
Makin' plans and you felt like mine
Look at me and I felt so Hollywood
But, baby, then you changed your mind
I got so fuckin' close to feelin' so good, so satisfied
I remember last summer in the city
Makin' plans and you felt like mine
Felt like mine, then I froze in time
You changed your mind
And I'll never know why
I get so serious sometimes
My emotions sittin' on a wire
And I gotta be out my mind
'Cause the second that I'm happy and I'm fine
Suddenly there's violins and movie scenes
And cryin' rivers in the streets
And, God, I don't know why I get so serious
I get so, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Violins and movie scenes
And cryin' rivers in the streets
And, God, I don't know why I get so serious sometimes
(So serious, so serious) Sometimes
â™ª
So serious sometimes
