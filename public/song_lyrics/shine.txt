Eyes, in the sky, gazing far into the night
I raise my hand to the fire, but it's no use
'Cause you can't stop it from shining through
It's true
Baby let the light shine through
If you believe it's true
Baby won't you let the light shine through
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
For you
Won't you let the light shine through
