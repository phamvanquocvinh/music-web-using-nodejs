One of us would die for love
One of us would give it up
One of us would risk it all
One of us won't even call
One of us could say goodbye
Never even bat an eye
One of us is hurtin' you
And baby, that's the last thing that I wanna do
Never did the thought ever cross
And never did I think I would stop
Forever, no one tells you the cost of paradise, paradise
Kisses, but they cut like a knife
I wish this was a little more bright
Once sweet words, now they come with a bite
Oh, hungry eyes, hungry eyes
I would give up the world, but it won't save us
It's killin' me inside out because
One of us would die for love
One of us would give it up
One of us would risk it all
One of us won't even call
One of us could say goodbye
Never even bat an eye
One of us is hurtin' you
And baby, that's the last thing that I wanna do
Wanna do, wanna do, wanna do
Wanna do, wanna do, wanna do
Wanna do, wanna do, wanna do
Wanna do
Question, is this how it goes down
In Heaven? Can someone let me out?
I'm beggin' 'cause I'm burnin' with doubt
I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin'
I would give up the world, but it won't save us
It's killin' me inside out because
One of us would die for love (die for love)
One of us would give it up (give it up)
One of us would risk it all
One of us won't even call (no, no, no)
One of us could say goodbye (goodbye)
Never even bat an eye
One of us is hurtin' you
And baby that's the last thing that I wanna do
Wanna do, wanna do, wanna do
Wanna do, wanna do, wanna do
Wanna do, wanna do, wanna do
Wanna do
Wanna do, wanna do, wanna do
Wanna do, wanna do, wanna do
Wanna do, wanna do
And baby, that's the last thing that I wanna do
