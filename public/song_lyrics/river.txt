I got a new dress just to meet you downtown
Can you walk me through the park just to show it off?
I can pull my hair back in that tight way that you like
If you wrap me in your arms and never stop
Heart beats so loud that it's drownin' me out
Livin' in an April shower
You're pourin' down, baby, drown me out (ooh-ooh, ooh)
You're just like a river (ooh-ooh, ooh)
You're just like a river (ooh-ooh, ooh)
You go on forever
You're just like a river
Blowin' bubbles in the bath, I can't stop from thinkin' lately
You could be the one, have the honor of my babies
Hope they have your eyes and that crooked smile
Was a desert 'fore I met you, I was in a drought
Heart beats so loud that it's drownin' me out
Livin' in an April shower
You're pourin' down, baby, drown me out (ooh-ooh, ooh)
You're just like a river (ooh-ooh, ooh)
You're just like a river (ooh-ooh, ooh)
You go on forever
You're just like a river
â™ª
You're never runnin' dry
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I feel you everywhere
Your face is all in my hair (hair)
Covered up in your sweat
It turns me on that you care, baby
Your love, it flows just like a river
You're just like a river (that's what you are)
You're just like a river (that's what you are)
You're just like a river (that's what you are)
You're just like a river
You're just like a river (heart beats so loud that it's drownin' me out)
You're just like a river (livin' in an April shower)
You go on forever (you're pourin' down, baby, drown me out)
You're just like a river
