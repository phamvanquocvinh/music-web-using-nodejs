Amazing, I'm driving 'round town in a beat-up old Mercedes
You'd think I'm crazy, you might be right
But when he smiles, I don't care about the past
Just like that
I told myself I closed that door, but I'm right back here again
I know half of what I'm saying don't make no sense
So, don't ask me where I've been
I'm not always right, but still, I ain't got time for what went wrong
Where I end up, I don't really care
I'm out of my mind, but still, I'm holding on like a rolling stone
A thousand miles from anywhere

I looked in the rear-view, I was talking to you 'fore I realized
It's madness before the sadness
Oh, I pick up the phone and I call back home, but all I get is a dial tone
And instead of hanging up, I hang my head
I told myself I closed that door, but I'm right back here again
I know half of what I'm saying don't make no sense
So, don't ask me where I've been
I'm not always right, but still, I ain't got time for what went wrong
Where I end up, I don't really care
I'm out of my mind, but still, I'm holding on like a rolling stone
It's a thousand miles from anywhere
