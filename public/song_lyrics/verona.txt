Can we kiss with poison on our lips?
Well, I'm not scared
Can we touch and taste forbidden bliss
They can't stop us now, I won't let you be alone
I am coming for you
Keep us apart, it's too much to ask
We're running away
Take off your clothes and take off your mask
It's not over now, I won't leave you in the dark
Because I need you so

Can we kiss contagion on our lips?
Well, I don't care
We can touch and feel forbidden bliss
They can't stop us now, I won't let you feel alone
Because I need you so
♪
You and me throw caution to the wind
And I will risk everything just to feel
The warmth and the voltage of your skin
If this is my last day on Earth, I just want to be with you
You are all that's true
We will kiss with poison on our lips
Well, I'm not scared
We will touch and reach forbidden bliss
They can't stop us now, I won't let you die alone
Because I love you so
