If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I'd put my money down and I'd sign my name
On that little corner lot where it don't ever rain
And we'd stay good as new like a fresh coat of paint
You'd be mine in the shine of a front porch light
Yeah, I might as well live there, baby
That's where I spend most of my time
Thinking 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings, lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over
If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I wouldn't have to wonder if you miss me the same
I'd be loving you as usual
Telling you you're beautiful
Oh, I'd be happily delusional
Thinking 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings, lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over

And baby, me and you would never fade, never fade
We'd never fade
Never fade, never fade
