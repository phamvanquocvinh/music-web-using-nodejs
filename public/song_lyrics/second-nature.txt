Dancing
Feeling like myself and now I'm dancing
Feeling so unstoppable, I know these things are
Bound to be surrounded in a moment forever on
You know I feel like it's alright because
There's something deep inside me you remind me of
It's not like it's just something, it's alive, and was
Before I ever knew you here at all, oh
This isn't second nature love
It's the first thing that comes to my being
I feel it like I feel it now, because
The rhythm, it keeps on repeating, it's on and on
Ah, and I feel it so right
♪
(Feel it so right)
♪
Uh, sweet music
Show me what to do and how to use it
Oh, all of the time I've loved it
Only just to find it in an omen already gone
So tell me everything it's meant to be
There's music in the moment like a melody
It's hidden in the way you always sing to me
I hear it like a song that's always on, on
This isn't second nature love (Oh)
It's the first thing that comes to my being
And I feel it like I feel it now because (Mmm)
It's the rhythm that keeps on repeating, it's on and on
I'm feeling so right
