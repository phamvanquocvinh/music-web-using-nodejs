Call me by name
This name I can't remember
I can't connect to
A vicious game
This calling to push forward
Yet expected to remain
All of these moving parts
From the start we were changing
I should have seen the signs
All the time we'll be staging
Bigger scenes and bigger stars
It's not hard to contain it
But to never lose it, well...
We've got the heart, it's true
Don't wanna waste love
Don't wanna hurt you, hurt you
Lifting off deeper blues
We're gonna pull through
We're gonna let heart hold true
We entertain these people that we create
That we dream of
'Til there remains no trace of what they stand for
What they could be
All of these moving parts
From the start we were changing
I should have seen the signs
All the time we'll be staging
Bigger scenes and bigger stars
It's not hard to contain it
But to never lose it, well...
We've got the heart, it's true
Don't wanna waste love
Don't wanna hurt you, hurt you
Lifting off deeper blues
We're gonna pull through
We're gonna let heart hold true
And for so long
I've lived my life listening to the wolves
Looking for scraps to tear from me 'til I lose control
Can't take my heart
No matter how your teeth sink and pull
Won't lose my heart
Won't lose my heart
