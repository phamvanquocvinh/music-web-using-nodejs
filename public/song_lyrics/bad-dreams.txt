Well if I've got a problem
You're the first one to know
But my feelings keep changing like stations on a radio
People act like optimists
Waiting for a good side to show
You already know
A piece of me is fading
I've had a change of heart
How many days are wasted
Before that space gets dark
I wanna give myself the best
But finding the time gets hard
You already know
All the bad dreams come and go
All the bad days come and go
All the bad dreams come and go
All the bad days come and go
Well if I've got a problem
You're the first one to know
First one to the party
Waiting for the crowd to show
Don't wanna be a pessimist
Living my life on hold
You already know
Ooh you already know
All the bad dreams come and go
All the bad days come and go
All the bad dreams come and go
All the bad days come and go
But you already know
