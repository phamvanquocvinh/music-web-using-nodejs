Do you wanna play house? I could be your wife
Go and meet your mom in a dress too tight
Maybe I could stay and not break your heart
But don't forget, baby, I'm a wildcard
I love when you hold me
But loving you is never enough
Don't wait for me
'Cause forever may never come
I'm a wildcard, oh-ooh
Loving you is never enough
I'm a wildcard, oh-ooh
Forever may never come
â™ª
I walk in the door, with my lips stained red
Pillows on the floor and the flowers dead
Make the music stop before it starts
'Cause don't forget, baby, I'm a wildcard
I love when you hold me
But loving you is never enough
I'm a wildcard, oh-ooh
Loving you is never enough
I'm a wildcard, oh-ooh
Forever may never come
And ooh, bet your loving
I want all in
I want all or nothing
Ooh, it'll cost ya
I want all in
I want all or nothing
I love when you hold me
But loving you is never enough
I'm a wildcard, oh-ooh
Loving you is never enough
I'm a wildcard, oh-ooh
Forever may never come
