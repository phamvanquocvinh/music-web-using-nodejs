You got, you got the cinema
♪
It's you
And I'm not gettin' over it
Darlin', is it cool
If I'm stubborn when it comes to this?
I guess we're in time
If you're getting yourself wet for me
I guess you're all mine
You're sleeping in this bed with me
I just think you're cool
I dig your cinema
Do you think I'm cool too?
Or am I too into you?
Tell me what you want and you got it, love
I want all of you, gimme all you got
That's cinema
That's cinema, uh-huh
It's you
Don't know why, but it feels so right to me
Something in the way you move
I like it when you dance for me (I just think it's-)
You all the time (time, time)
In doses at night (night, night)
No roof on the drive
Dust off the high
And go to sleep (go to sleep, go to sleep)
I just think you're cool
I dig your cinema
Do you think I'm cool, too?
Or am I too into you?
I just think you're cool (co-cool)
I dig your cinema (cinema)
Do you think I'm cool, too?
Or am I (cinema) too into you?
