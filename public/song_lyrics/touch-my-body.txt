MC, uh uh uh
In the place to be (oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
I know that you been waitin' for it, I'm waitin' too
In my imagination I be all up on you
I know you got that fever for me hundred and two
And boy I know I feel the same my temperature's through the roof
If it's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me when I do, I do
If it's a camera up in here
Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube, YouTube
'Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, between you and I
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves
C'mon and give me what I deserve and touch my body
Boy you can put me on you like a brand new white tee
I'll hug your body tighter than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze
And float away with you in a Caribbean sea
If it's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me when I do, I do
If it's a camera up in here
Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube, YouTube
'Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, between you and I
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves
C'mon and give me what I deserve and touch my body
I'ma treat you like a teddy bear, you won't wanna go nowhere
In the lap of luxury, laying intertwined with me
You won't want for nothing boy (no)
I will give you plenty of joy
Touch my body, put me on the floor (put me on the floor)
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves (I know you like it)
C'mon and give me what I deserve (Give me what I just said that)
And touch my body
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Yea, yea
Every little way you like to touch my body, baby
(Just touch my body)
Yeah, ooh ooh baby
Ooh, ooh ooh
(Touch my body)
C'mon and give me what I deserve
