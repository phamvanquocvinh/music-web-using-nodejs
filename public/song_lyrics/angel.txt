How we gonna touch base? Like throwback
Drinking Cherry B, doin' blow backs
Shawty we were watching Big Mouth and Bojack
Now I'm lookin' for another reason to phone back
You sweet and cold like Häagen-Dazs, my palms are fast
I'm sweating like a Dalston bar, I'm hardly far
I'ma show you what I wanna, like Mostack
You a rockstar and you know that
Overheard conversations
Came from underworked aspirations
They see what we do and it's easy to doubt it
We focus on self and they wan' talk about it
But if I found a place for us
Would you find your place in me?
Pace for my inner peace
Peace on my remedy
You pull me close waking up
We fit like a puzzle piece
Taking my time with you
You nourish my energy
Angel, I'll come back
Don't you wait too long
In a wonderland
But this Avalon ain't right
When I'm lonely at night
I just need you right here
So we can carry on
We don't need no complication
I'ma chill out, do my meditation
I don't wanna hear no bad vibes
Shawty know I get my sage on
And you know I'm a good girl
Maybe a little too flirtatious
Heart in a good place
And I'm down for you to take it
You sweet and cold like Häagen-Dazs, my palms are fast
I'm sweating like a Dalston bar, I'm hardly far
Fill you up with laughter after making love
Fill you up with laughter after making love
Every time we fucking, spitting, choking up
Pupils dilating, want you down and up
Show you what I wanna, like Mostack
You a rockstar and you know that
Would you come wherever I go?
Slowly falling nowhere
Moments haze as days go by
But always, I'll wait for sure
Ride into the sun
Dive out of my mind
I get lost sometimes
Those days you say that I was doing better
