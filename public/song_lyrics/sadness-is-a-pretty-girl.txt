I don't mind if you choke me with your eyes
Lullabies that you sang never helped you through the night
And I've been travelling to hide from my own face
So please, just let me stay, lonely ghost
â™ª
Teenage soul, teardrop love, don't let me go
My cold hands carry your songs 'cause they truly feel like (no)
And you've been answering my endless drowning state
I like your pretty face, the blurry taste of hope
