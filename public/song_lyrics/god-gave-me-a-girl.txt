I gave it hell on Friday nights
All about that single life
I gave my mama a reason to pray
Didn't care about trying to change, no
I gave my all to those empty bars
They always left me with a broken heart
Never really ever gave love a thought
Man, as soon as I swore it off
God gave me a girl, girl gave me a kiss
Kiss gave me a feeling that I still get
Every time I look in her eyes
I don't deserve her and I don't know why
She gave me her hand and I gave her a ring
Then as soon as I could, I gave her my last name
Now, I'm gonna give her forever
I knew what I wanted, but he knew better
God gave me a girl, mmm
â™ª
Yeah, yeah
The boys gave me a hard time
'Cause I was giving her all of mine
But the first time they met her is when they understood
Said, "How'd you get one so good?"
God gave me a girl, girl gave me a kiss
Kiss gave me a feeling that I still get
Every time I look in her eyes
I don't deserve her and I don't know why
She gave me her hand and I gave her a ring
Then as soon as I could, I gave her my last name
Now, I'm gonna give her forever
I knew what I wanted, but he knew better
God gave me a girl
At just the right time
And I'd give her the world
'Cause she changed mine
God gave me a girl, girl gave me a kiss
Kiss gave me a feeling that I still get
Every time I look in her eyes
I don't deserve her and I don't know why
She gave me her hand and I gave her a ring
Then as soon as I could, I gave her my last name
Now, I'm gonna give her forever
I knew what I wanted, but he knew better
God gave me a girl
God gave me a girl
Oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
God gave me a girl
