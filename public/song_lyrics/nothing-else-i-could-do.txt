I waited up for your call
You never told me you would
But the way that you smiled was a promise, I swear
Fell asleep by the phone
I missed a message or two
Deleted them 'cause they weren't you
I wrecked my house a hundred times just to see you walk into a room
But there was money in your laugh, so babe
There's nothing else I could do
Oh babe, there's nothing else I could do
(There's nothing else I could)
I miss the shape of your voice
I miss the nape of your neck
I miss the weight of your words
I miss the bruises they left
Started reading the Times
Just to look for your name
I couldn't find it
They must have made a mistake
I broke my knuckles in a fight
You were crying in the back of the room
And now the world is on fire, but babe
There's nothing else I could do
Oh babe, there's nothing else I could do
â™ª
And they can dance to the songs
And they can drink all the wine
Because the high might be theirs
But all the bottles were mine
And then you're crashing my car
And now I'm taking the blame
There's nothing else I could do
They must have made a mistake, oh
Babe, they must have made a mistake, oh
They must have made a mistake
Oh babe, there's nothing else I could do
Oh babe, there's nothing else I could do
There's nothing else I could-
