It's a cold night in my bed in the heat of the summer
I've been waiting patiently for a beautiful lover
He's not a cheater, a believer
He's a warm, warm blooded achiever
It's a lonely night in my bed in the heat of the summer, uh
It's so hard when you're with someone
Your heart breaks and it ain't no fun
But I gotta take that risk tonight
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready
For someone to love me (for someone to love me)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
For someone to love me
For someone to love me

Oh, yeah
It's a hot night in my head in the chill of the winter
No, I've been lookin' hard for a lover disguised as a sinner
No, not a cheater, a redeemer
He's a cold, cold blooded defeater
It's a hot night in my head in the chill of the winter, no
It's so hard when you're with someone
Your heart breaks and it ain't no fun (breaks)
But I gotta take that risk tonight (tonight)
I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready
For someone to love me (for someone to love me)
I'm ready (I'm ready), I'm ready (I'm ready)
