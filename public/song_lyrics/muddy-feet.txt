I don't know
Who the hell you think you're messing with
Get the fuck out of my house with that shit
Get the fuck out of my life with that shit
And I don't know
Who the hell you think you're messing with
Get the fuck out of my house with that shit
Get the fuck out of my life with that shit
And you smell like perfume that I didn't purchase
Now I know why you've been closing the curtains (uh-uh)
Get the fuck out of my house
You're coming 'round with your muddy feet
I'm about to do something 'bout it
Yeah, I'ma have to do something 'bout it
You keep coming 'round with your muddy feet
And I'ma have to do something 'bout it
Yeah, I'm about to do something 'bout it
Back and forth
Always questioning my questioning
Get the fuck out of my head with that shit
Get the fuck out of my bed with that shit
You've watered the weeds, and you killed all the roses
Worthy arrives when the other door closes, uh-uh
So get the fuck out of my house with that shit
You're coming 'round (coming 'round, baby) with your muddy feet
I'm about to do something 'bout it (what I do)
Yeah, I'ma have to do something 'bout it (what I do)
And I don't know who you're messing with
Yeah, I'ma have to do something 'bout it (what I do)
Yeah, I'm about to do something 'bout it (what I do)
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, hmm
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, hmm
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, hmm (you're coming 'round)
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, hmm (you're coming 'round, baby)
(What I do, what I do)
Get the fuck out of my house with that shit
