Tell 'em to shoot
I'm out the loop, I'm outta range
Oh-yeah, I stay out the way-ay-ay!
Got another side of me, I like to get it poppin'
But these bitches in my business got me outchea choosin' violence
If you see me out in public, you don't know me, keep it silent
In the bedroom, I be screamin', but outside, I keep it quiet
Keep it on the lowski, I'm the lowest of the lowest
Wanna see if you can keep it like nobody knows shit
I need you to get the fuck out of my space (yeah)
Replacement's on the way, please don't play
That pussy's feelin' like a great escape (oh, oh)
Don't need no trick, old dogs don't change
I'm fuckin', I ain't makin' love no more (pussy)
You got a new bitch, what the fuck you cryin' for?
I'm movin' selfish, callin' all my favorite hoes
You know how to reach me every time and it plays in your mind
With a rush that feels like, we committin' a crime
You know where you belong, I'm gon' save you a spot
But we can't be outside 'cause the block is too hot
And I'm all on your mind
Wherever you are, don't call me! (Let's go)
