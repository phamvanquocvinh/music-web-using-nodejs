Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnightâˆ’
Oh, God, I'm clean out of air in my lungs
It's all gone, played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move along with the truth
Ooh (Hey)
We're sleepin' through all the days
I'm actin' like I don't see
Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me
But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me? Go astray with me? (Ah-ha)
King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Ah, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Oh, God, I'm closin' my teeth around this liquor-wet lime
Midnight, lose my mind, I know you're feelin' it too
Can we keep up with the ruse? Ah-ah-ah (Hey)
B-bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart
Jack and Jill get f*cked up and possessive when it gets dark
But my hips have missed your hips
So let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me? Go astray with me? (Ah ha)
King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Ah, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Ah, when you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Midnight, we're fadin'
'Til daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the mornin', you'll be dancin' with all the heartache
And the treason, the fantasies of leavin'
But we know that, when it's over
In the mornin', you'll be dancin' with us
(Midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
Oh, dancin' with us
(Midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Oh, you'll be dancin' with us
(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)
Dancin' with us, us
(But what will we do when we're sober?) Us
When you get to my high (Midnight, lose my mind)
When you get to my (Midnight, lose my mind)
