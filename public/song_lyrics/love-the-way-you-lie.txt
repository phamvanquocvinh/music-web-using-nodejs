Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now it's a still night in my wind pipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off the law, drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it.
Wait! Where you going? I'm leaving you
No you ain't. Come back we're running right back.
Here we go again
It's so insane cus when its going good its going great.
I'm superman with the wind at his back
Shes Louis Lane but when its bad its awful, I feel so ashamed I snap
Who's that dude? I don't even know his name
I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
When you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at him
You swore you'd never hit him; never do nothing to hurt him
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him
Throw him down pin him
So lost in the moments when you're in them
It's a race that's the culprit controls your boat
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess if they don't know you cus today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
Next time you show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
I guess that's why they call it window pane
Now I know he said things hit things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back
It wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship wasn't as crazy as it seemed
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
I told you this is my fault
Look me in the eye ball
Next time I'm pissed, I lay my fist at the drywall
Next time. There won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know its lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
