She's a wonder woman
She knows what she likes
Never know she's broken
'Cause she's always fine
She's a million moments
Lived a thousand lives
Never know she's hopeless
Only when she cries
When her favorite record's on and she's dancing in the dark
She can't stop her eyes from welling up, up
She makes sure that no one's 'round to see her fall apart
She wants to be the one that never does
She's a won't-stop woman
Hours on her hands
All the pain is polished
All the tears are planned
But when her favorite record's on and she's dancing in the dark
She can't stop her eyes from welling up, up
She makes sure that no one's 'round to see her fall apart
She wants to be the one that never does
She's a wonder woman
She knows what she likes
Never know she's broken
Only when she cries
