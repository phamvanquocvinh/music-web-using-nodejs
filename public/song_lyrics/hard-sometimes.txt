I'm waking up my mind
I'm just trying to kill the silence
♪
I'm ripping off the blinds
I'm just trying to let some light in
♪
But I've been on the road
I've been missing home
See it on my phone that the world back there
Keep spinning 'round without me
♪
I'm waking up my mind
I'm ripping off the blinds
Oh I (Oh I)
Try to be happy but it's hard sometimes
But life (But life)
Just seems to happen right before my eyes
'Cause I feel like I'm not there
'Cause my head is up somewhere
Far away from all my friends
I just want that back again
Oh I (Oh I)
Try to be happy but it's hard sometimes
It's hard sometimes
But when I come off cold
I'm not doing it on purpose
♪
You caught me in a hole
That I dig for myself when I'm nervous
I've been on the road
I've been missing home
See it on my phone that my friends back there
Got inside jokes without me
Oh, woah
Don't mean to come off cold
I don't want to be alone
Oh I (Oh I)
Try to be happy but it's hard sometimes (Hard sometimes)
But life (But life)
Just seems to happen right before my eyes (Before my eyes)
'Cause I feel like I'm not there
'Cause my head is up somewhere
Far away from all my friends
I just want that back again
Oh I (Oh I)
Try to be happy but it's hard sometimes
(Hard sometimes)
I don't feel like myself and
I can't help being selfish
Sometimes the pressure gets the best of me
Oh I, oh I
Oh I
Try to be happy but it's hard sometimes
But life
Just seems to happen, it's just passing by, oh
'Cause I feel like I'm not there
'Cause my head is up somewhere
Far away from all my friends
I just want that back again
Oh I (Oh I)
Try to be happy but it's hard sometimes
(Hard sometimes)
'Cause it's hard sometimes
