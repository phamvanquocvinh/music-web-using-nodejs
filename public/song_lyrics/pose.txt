n the middle of the floor my eyes are closed
Resume the first pose
Lay my arms to the side the lights are low
Cue the fog machine to run real slow
No faces seen in the mirror she's on her own
You had your chance the routine was made for you
But now you're dancing with them 2 by 2
I'm on my knees don't you dare come and dance with me
Oh, can't you see I'm groovin' alone?
As long as I pose I don't care if you're next to me
(Pose 1, pose 2, pose 3)
I'm on my knees don't you dare come and dance with me
Oh, can't you see I'm groovin' alone?
As long as I pose I don't care if you're next to me
It's raining hard on the outside I'm movin' on the inside
(Movin' on the inside)
The window's cracked, so the outside can move like the inside
Head in the stars until I hit the floor
She'll know the song the steps forever more
(But now you're dancing with them 2 by 2)
I'm on my knees don't you dare come and dance with me
Oh, can't you see I'm groovin' alone?
As long as I pose I don't care if you're next to me
(Pose 1, pose 2, pose 3)
I'm on my knees don't you dare come and dance with me
Oh, can't you see I'm groovin' alone?
As long as I pose I don't care if you're next to me
Not long 'til I'm takin' that fall
'Til I give into the rhythm and I'm getting back up again
Not long 'til I'm takin' that fall
'Til I give into the rhythm and I'm getting back up again
Not long 'til I'm takin' that fall
'Til I give into the rhythm and I'm getting back up again
Not long 'til I'm takin' that fall
'Til I give into the rhythm and I'm getting back up again
I'm on my knees don't you dare come and dance with me
Oh, can't you see I'm groovin' alone?
As long as I pose I don't care if you're next to me
(Pose 1, pose 2, pose next to me)
