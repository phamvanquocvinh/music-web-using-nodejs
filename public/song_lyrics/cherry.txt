Hello, can I speak to...
Oh, never mind
So won't you? Will you be my cherry?
So come on talk to me, talk to me
Will you, will you be mine?
One, two, three, let's go
Down the subway, you looked my way
With your girl gaze, with your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Couldn't stay the same
Now it's Tuesday and I'm thinking
'Bout to tuck in, 'bout to tuck in
Telling myself that it's cheating
But it's something else
Even though I'm satisfied
I lead my life within a lie
♪
Holding onto feelings
I'm not used to feeling
'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive
When they tell you that you've got to stay the same
Even though you're not yourself
And you've got somebody else
When they tell you that you've got yourself to blame
Even though it's not your fault
But your heart just wants to know, know
Down the subway, you looked my way
With your girl gaze, with your girl gaze
That was the day everything changed
Now it's something else
Even though I'm satisfied
I lead my life within a lie
Holding onto feelings
I'm not used to feeling
'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive
So won't you? Will you be my cherry?
So come on, talk to me, talk to me
Will you, will you be mine?
I see you watching me, will you be mine baby?
Will I be your cherry?
So come on, talk to me, talk to me
Will you, will you be mine?
With one look you take me back to everything I used to be
When everyone was 17 with no ID, no ID
Love no one and love myself
It's not that us is guaranteed
'Cause inside I'm still the same me with no ID, no ID
Won't you be my cherry now?
Even though I'm satisfied
I lead my life within a lie
Holding onto feelings
I'm not used to feeling
'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive
Even though I'm satisfied
I lead my life within a lie
