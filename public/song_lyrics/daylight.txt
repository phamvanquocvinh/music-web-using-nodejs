I'm on the roof, you're in your airplane seat
I was nose-bleeding, looking for life out there
Reading your horoscope, you were just doing cocaine
In my kitchen, you never listen, I hope you're missing me by now
♪
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (ooh)
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (ooh)
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep 'til the daylight (ooh)

Out of New York, I'm on the comedown speed
We're on bicycles, saying, "There's life out there"
You got the antidote, I'll take one to go, go, please
Get the picture, cut out my middle
You ain't got time for me right now
If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you
